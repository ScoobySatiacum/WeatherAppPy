# WeatherAppPy
Weather application written in Python.

## Usage

To use this application you will need to request a free API key from https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up

Once an API key has been obtained a config.py file will need to be generated in order to utilize the API key with the script.

A sample version has been provided below. This can be copy and pasted into a blank config.py file:

class Config:
    
    API_KEY = 'PERSONAL_API_KEY'

Once the above has been completed execute main.py.
